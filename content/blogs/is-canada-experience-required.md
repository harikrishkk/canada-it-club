## Is Canada experience required

- If you are a new comer to Canada, you will see few recruiters asking you for previous Canadian Experience. You may feel that you get rejected for a job due to lack of Canadian Experience. 

- Even though it is illegal to reject a candidate based on lack of Canadian experience, you may encounter this situation during your first job search in Canada. 

- So what is Canadian experience & Is it required to get a job in Canada? Why are companies asking for Canadian Experience before they hire someone? 

- Some companies/roles prefer candidates who have been working in Canada for sometime, who understands Canadian work culture & how to deal with the things in office. If you are from India, it doesnâ€™t matter most of the time, because you have been working with Global clients even back in India, and most of you are aware about the western work culture. 



## But then why do the companies demand Canadian Experience for some roles? 


- For the tech resources such as developers, testers, network admins etc, the Canadian experience might not be a big factor while selecting the candidate. For BA/BSA and those related to domain, it would be easy to get a job if you have Domain expertise which is required for the job. You can easily get a job without having Canadian experience. But being said, good communication skills are a must for any roles.

- But for senior roles such as Program Managers, Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches, BDM, HR manager etc, the companies prefer someone with experience in local markets to ensure they understand the work culture of Canada. This is because these roles require you to manage the team members. You need to give importance to the work life balance, family & other parameters of the employee when that person is working for you. This is a bit different than what we see back in our home country. For e.g. In India, you might be ordered to work late or work during a sick leave if your manager is not a good human being. In Canada, the employee has rights to decline the request to work during the personal time. So when there is a team management involved, few employers prefer candidates who have been working in the Canadian industry to avoid such situations. 

### To wrap it up

Again, it is not a hard and fast written rule. But lot of firms give opportunities to new immigrants based on their past experience in their home country.
