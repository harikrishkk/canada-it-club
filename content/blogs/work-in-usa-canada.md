## I would love to know if it is better working in USA or Canada

This comparison is solely based on a personal experience from the IT professional stand point.

### IT Opportunities:

🇺🇸 Opportunities are really high in US
🇨🇦 Canada is a comparatively small market compared to US

### Package/Salary: 

The salary/contract rates are higher in US compared to Canada

### Location:

🇺🇸 IT market is wide spread across US. You get better options to choose the location

🇨🇦 The choice of location is limited. The IT is focused on few areas such as Montreal, GTA, Vancouver and few other cities. 

### Cost of Living: 

The cost of living in US is less compared to Canada. In Canada, most of the things are expensive

### Housing: 

From my experience, Canada's housing is too expensive🙁. Very tough to afford & high yearly appreciation. 

### Weather: 

🇺🇸 The weather is better in US, especially if you move towards South. So if you don't like cold weather, you have multiple options in US

🇨🇦 Its cold 🥶. Because of limitations of opportunites, we may not be able to move to British Columbia where the weather is better.


### Immigration: 

🇺🇸 Immigration is tougher. High level of uncertainty on immigration process. Anytime things will change 🙁

🇨🇦 Immigration friendly country. Easy to immigrate to Canada when compared to US. 😊

### Ease of immigration: 

🇺🇸 An indian citizen has to wait for a decade at least to get a PR card. 

🇨🇦 Express entry in place. Immigrate within 6 months (due to covid, there is a backlog. Before that it was very easy) 


### Work Culture: 

I haven't seen much difference in work culture. Toronto has similar work culture as NY. 

### Family visit: 

🇺🇸 Parents can visit up to 6 months. 
🇨🇦 Parents can visit & stay up to 2 years. Canada promotes bringing parents to stay with you 😊


### Medical:

🇺🇸 Insurance is required. High cost of medical expense.
🇨🇦 Medical is free. Insurance covered by Government. 

### Quality of Medical Care: 

I feel quality of medical care is better in 🇺🇸 than 🇨🇦. The medical services is not that great in Canada. 

### In case of Job loss: 

🇺🇸 Your insurance gets cut out. You are not covered under medical. 
🇨🇦 You don't have to worry about the medical insurance by employer. So peace of mind. 

### Spousal Job: 

🇺🇸 If you are in H1B visa, it will be tough for the spouse to work 
🇨🇦 Spouses have better work opportunity

### Job Loss (work permit) : 

🇺🇸 If you are in work permit, you need to find a job within 90 days. Or else you need to leave the country. I have seen instances where people were not able to secure job within 90 days. 

🇨🇦 Canada is very lenient in the work permit processing. You will not be asked to leave the country. Very lesser instances of people loosing job in work permit and not able to secure another job
